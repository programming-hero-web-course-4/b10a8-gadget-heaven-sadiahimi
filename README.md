## React Concepts Used
- **React Functional Components**: Used to create reusable components like `Navbar`, `Banner`, and `Footer`.
- **Props**: Passed data dynamically to `ProductCard` and `Banner`.
- **State Management**: Used `useState` to manage filtered products.
- **useEffect**: Fetched data and handled side effects in `ProductDetails.js`.
- **React Router**: Implemented for navigating between pages (`Home`, `Statistics`, and `Product Details`).
- **Toast Notifications**: Used `react-toastify` for user feedback.

## Data Management
- **Data Handling**: Managed data using local state with `useState`.
